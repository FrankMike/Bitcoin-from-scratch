    "\n",
    "Bitcoin is a software program that runs on a decentralized network of computers. The software defines the rules of Bitcoin, including how transactions are verified and how new bitcoins are created.\n",
    "Bitcoin uses cryptography to secure transactions and to prevent fraud. Cryptography is the science of encrypting and decrypting data. In Bitcoin, cryptography is used to create digital signatures, which are used to verify the authenticity of transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bitcoin is a decentralized currency, meaning that it is not controlled by any central authority. The Bitcoin network is run by a network of volunteers around the world.\n",
    "All Bitcoin transactions are recorded on the blockchain, which is a public ledger. This means that anyone can view the history of Bitcoin transactions.\n",

    "### Finite fields\n",
    "\n",
    "Finite fields, also known as Galois fields, are fundamental mathematical structures used in various fields, including algebra, coding theory, cryptography, and computer science.\n",
    "\n",
    "A field is a mathematical structure that consists of a set of elements along with two binary operations: addition and multiplication, which satisfy certain properties.\n",
    "Specifically, a field must satisfy the following conditions:\n",
    "- Closure: The result of addition or multiplication of any two elements in the field is also an element in the field.\n",
    "- Associativity: Addition and multiplication operations are associative.\n",
    "- Commutativity: Both addition and multiplication are commutative; the order of operands does not matter.\n",
    "- Identity Elements: There exist unique elements called the additive and multiplicative identities (denoted as 0 and 1, respectively) such that adding or multiplying any element by these identities leaves the element unchanged.\n",
    "- Inverse Elements: Every nonzero element in the field has a unique additive and multiplicative inverse.\n",
    "- Distributive Property: Multiplication distributes over addition.\n",
    "\n",
    "A finite field is a field that has a finite number of elements. The order of a finite field is the number of elements it contains. For any finite field, the order is a prime power, represented as \"q,\" where \"q\" is a prime number raised to a positive integer power.\n",
    "\n",
    "The characteristic of a finite field is the smallest positive integer \"p\" such that summing \"p\" copies of the multiplicative identity (1) yields the additive identity (0). The characteristic can be either a prime number or zero. If the characteristic is zero, the field is said to have characteristic zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finite fields can be constructed using various methods, but the most common method is through polynomial construction. For each prime power \"q,\" there exists a unique (up to isomorphism) finite field of order \"q.\" This finite field is denoted as GF(q) or Fq. The elements of a finite field Fq are usually denoted as 0, 1, 2, ..., q-1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finite fields can have subfields, which are smaller fields contained within the original finite field. These subfields can also be finite fields themselves. Additionally, one can create extensions of finite fields by defining new finite fields with larger orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each prime power \"q,\" there is a unique finite field of order \"q\" up to isomorphism. This means that any two finite fields of the same order are essentially the same in terms of their algebraic properties, even though they might be represented with different sets of elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The study of finite fields is closely related to Galois theory, a branch of abstract algebra. Galois theory explores the relationship between field extensions and symmetries of polynomial equations. Finite fields are an important example of finite field extensions in Galois theory."

    "### Modulo arithmetic\n",
    "\n",
    "Modulo arithmetic, also known as clock arithmetic or modular arithmetic, is a fundamental branch of arithmetic that deals with numbers' remainders after division. It is a way of performing arithmetic operations on integers that are constrained to a fixed positive integer, known as the modulus.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of modulo arithmetic, let's consider two integers: a (the dividend) and m (the modulus), where m is a positive integer greater than 1. The symbol used to denote the modulo operation is \"mod.\" The result of the modulo operation is the remainder obtained when dividing 'a' by 'm'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, the modulo operation is represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "a mod m = r\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, 'r' represents the remainder obtained when 'a' is divided by 'm'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key properties of modulo arithmetic:\n",
    "\n",
    "Range constraint: The result of the modulo operation is always within the range of 0 to (m - 1). In other words, 0 â‰¤ (a mod m) â‰¤ (m - 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Congruence: If two integers 'a' and 'b' have the same remainder when divided by 'm', they are said to be congruent modulo 'm', represented as a â‰¡ b (mod m). This means (a mod m) = (b mod m).\n",
    "\n",
    "Common arithmetic operations in modulo arithmetic:\n",
    "\n",
    "Addition: To perform addition in modulo arithmetic, simply add the two numbers and take the result modulo 'm'.\n",
    "\n",
    "(a + b) mod m = (a mod m + b mod m) mod m\n",
    "\n",
    "Subtraction: To perform subtraction, similarly subtract the two numbers and take the result modulo 'm'.\n",
    "\n",
    "(a - b) mod m = (a mod m - b mod m) mod m\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiplication: For multiplication, multiply the two numbers and then take the result modulo 'm'.\n",
    "\n",
    "(a * b) mod m = (a mod m * b mod m) mod m\n",
    "\n",
    "Exponentiation: For exponentiation, raise 'a' to the power of 'b' and take the result modulo 'm'.\n",
    "\n",
    "(a^b^) mod m = (a mod m)^b^ mod m\n",
    "\n",
    "Modulo arithmetic finds numerous applications in various fields, including computer science, cryptography, number theory, and digital signal processing. In computer science, it is used in hashing functions, random number generation, and cyclic data structures. In cryptography, it forms the basis of some encryption and decryption algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modulo arithmetic has a cyclical nature, akin to a clock that repeats itself after completing a full circle. This property makes it a valuable tool in solving problems involving periodicity and repetitions.\n",

    "For the purposes of generating key in the public key cryptography, finite cyclic groups are what we need.\n",

    "Taking a generator point from an elliptic curve over a finite field is possible to generate a finite cyclic group. Unlike fields, groups have only a single operation, the point addition. Groups have a few properties like closure, invertibility, commutativity, associativity, and lastly the identity.\n",

    "\n",
    "Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is a type of asymmetric or public key cryptography based on the algebraic structures of the elliptic curves over finite fields and on the discrete logarithm problem as expressed by addition and multiplication on the points of the curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "The foundation of ECC lies in the mathematical properties of elliptic curves. An elliptic curve is a smooth curve defined by an equation of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "y^2^ = x^3^ + ax + b\n",
    "\n",
    "'a' and 'b' are constants that define the specific curve's shape, and the coordinates 'x' and 'y' represent points on the curve. However, these coordinates must satisfy certain conditions. One key property of elliptic curves is that they have an additive group structure, allowing for point addition and scalar multiplication operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "ECC uses this group structure to create cryptographic key pairs: a private key and a corresponding public key. The private keys in the ECC (usually denoted as 'd') are integers (in the range of the curve's field size, typically 256-bit integers).\n",
    "The key generation in the ECC cryptography is as simple as securely generating a random integer in certain range, so any number within the range is a valid ECC private key.\n",
    "\n",
    "The public key is a point on the elliptic curve obtained by multiplying the generator point by the private key\n",
    "\n",
    "Public key (P) = Private key (d) * Generator point (G)\n",
    "\n",
    "ECC crypto algorithms can use different underlying elliptic curves. Different curves provide different levels of security, performance and key length.\n",
    "\n",
    "A point at infinity is needed to be part of the curve, and this point can be denoted as 0 (zero).\n",
    "\n",
    "The ECC uses elliptic curves over the finite field Fp, where p is prime and p > 3.\n",
    "This means that the field is a square matrix of size p x p and the points on the curve are limited to integer coordinates within the field only.\n",
    "\n",
    "ECC is employed in two primary cryptographic functions: key exchange and digital signatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Key Exchange:\n",
    "ECC allows two parties to agree on a shared secret key over an insecure channel securely. The parties exchange their public keys, perform point multiplication using their private keys and the received public keys, and arrive at the same shared secret point. This point is then used to derive a symmetric encryption key or to initialize a secure communication session.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Digital Signatures:\n",
    "In ECC-based digital signatures, the private keyholder signs a message using their private key to produce a unique signature. The signature can be publicly verified using the corresponding public key. Verifying the signature involves performing point operations to ensure the authenticity and integrity of the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Elliptic Curve Cryptography offers strong security with relatively smaller key sizes compared to traditional cryptographic algorithms, making it a popular choice for various applications in the modern digital landscape, including secure communications, digital signatures, and secure key exchange protocols.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### SHA256\n",
    "\n",
    "The SHA256 algorithm can be summarized in 6 macro steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The data padding where the input data is padded to ensure its length is a multiple of 512 bits (64 bytes). Padding includes appending a 1 bit, followed by a sequence of 0 bits and finally the original length of the input in bits (64 bits) as a big-endian 64 bit integer.\n",
    "2. Initialization. The algorithm initializes eight 32 bit words, called \"working variables\", with specific constant values. It also defines a 64 element \"message schedule\" array that will be used in the computation.\n",
    "3. Message Processing: the padded input data is divided into 512 bit blocks, and each block undergoes a series of computations.\n",
    "4. Compression Function: Each block is further divided into sixteen 32 bit words forming the message schedule array.\n",
    "From the 17th word onwards, additional words are generated using a specific formula based on the previously generated words.\n",
    "5. Round operations: The message schedule words and working variables go through a series of rounds (64 rounds in total). Each round involves various bitwise operations such as XOR, AND, OR, as well as logical functions such as Ch (choose), Maj (majority), and Sigma functions.\n",
    "6. Final Hash Value: After processing all blocks, the final hash value is derived by concatenating the values of the working variables in their respective order. These values represent the 256 bit hash value of the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting SHA256 hash is tipically represented as a sequence of 64 hexadecimal digits providing a compact and unique representation of the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "SHA256 plays a crucial role in Bitcoin. Bitcoin utilizes SHA256 as part of its underlying cryptographic algorithms for several key operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mining: Bitcoin mining involves the process of adding new transactions to the blockchain and creating new blocks. Miners compete to solve a computationally intensive mathematical puzzle, the proof-of-work.\n",
    "The proof-of-work algorithm relies on SHA256. Miners take the block header, which includes the transactions and other metadata, and concatenate it with random number called a nonce. They then hash this combined data using SHA-256 repeatedly until they find a hash that meets specific criteria (target difficulty). This process requires significant computational power, and the miner who succesfully finds a valid hash is rewarded with newly minted bitcoins.\n",
    "2. Block Verification: Each block in the blockchain is verified by nodes in the network to ensure its validity. As part of the verification process, the block header is hashed using SHA-256, and the resulting hash is compared to the previous block's hash. This ensures the integrity and continuity of the blockchain.\n",
    "3. Transaction Verification: SHA256 is used to verify the integrity of individual transactions within a block. Each transaction has a unique transaction ID, which is calculated by hashing the transaction data, including inputs, outputs, and metadata, using SHA256.\n",
    "Nodes in the network can independently verify that the transaction ID matches the transaction data, ensuring that the transaction has not been tampered with. Additionally, the transaction ID is used in the construction of Merkle trees, which provide an efficient way to confirm the inclusion of transactions in a block.\n",
    "4. Address Generation: Bitcoin addresses are derived from public keys using a series of cryptographic operations, including SHA256. Public keys are hashed twice, first with SHA256 and then with RIPEMD160 resulting in a unique address. This ensures that each Bitcoin address is associated with a specific public key, providing a level of privacy for users."

    "#### Base58 and Base58Check Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to represent long numbers in a compact way, computer systems use mixed-alphanumeric representations with a base higher than 10. For example the hexadecimal system uses 16 with the letters A through F as the six additional simbols. So a number represented in hexadecimal format is shorter than the equivalent decimal representation. Base64 representation uses 26 lover case letter, 26 capital letters, 10 numerals and 2 more characters such as + and / to transmit binary data over text-based media such as email.\n",
    "\n",
    "Base58 is a text-based binary-encoding format developed for use in Bitcoin. Base58 is a subset of Base64, omitting few characters that are frequently mistaken for one another. Specifically those symbols are 0 (the number zero), O (capital o), l (lower L), I (capital i), and the symbols + and /.\n",
    "\n",
    "To add extra security against typos and transcription errors Base58Check is a Base58 encoding format which has a built-in error-checking code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The checksum is an additional four bytes added to the end of the data that is being encoded, and is derived from the hash of the encoded data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here follows a step-by-step breakdown of how Base58Check encoding works:\n",
    "1. Start with the raw data, such as a Bitcoin address or a Public Key.\n",
    "2. Take the raw data and add a version byte in front of it. The version byte is usually used to indicate the network type (mainnet, testnet, etc.) or the type of data being encoded.\n",
    "3. Calculate the double-SHA256 hash of the version byte and the raw data.\n",
    "4. Take the first four bytes of the double-SHA256 hash calculated in the previous step. These four bytes will serve as the checksum.\n",
    "5. Append the four-byte checksum to the end of the version byte and raw data.\n",
    "6. Convert the resulting binary data (version byte + raw data + checksum) into a large integer.\n",
    "7. Encode the large integer from step 6 using the Base58 encoding scheme. This involves representing the integer in Base58 using a set of characters that excludes confusing or similar-looking characters.\n",
    "8. Finally, prepend a certain number of '1' characters to the Base58 encoded data to represent leading zero bytes in the original data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting Base58Check encoded string is the final Bitcoin address.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's possible to create a subclass of both the field element and the point to work exclusively with the parameter of *secp256k1*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Public Key Cryptography\n",
    "\n",
    "Public key cryptography involves a pair of keys known as a public key and a private key (a public key pair), which are associated with an entity that needs to authenticate its identity electronically or to sign or encrypt data.\n",
    "Security of public-key cryptography depends on keeping the private key secret; the public key can be openly distributed without compromising security.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a public-key encryption system, anyone with a public key can encrypt a message, yielding a ciphertext, but only those who know the corresponding private key can decrypt the ciphertext to obtain the original message.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a digital signature system, a sender can use a private key together with a message to create a signature. Anyone with the corresponding public key can verify whether the signature matches the message, but a forger who does not know the private key cannot find any message/signature pair that will pass verification with the public key.\n",
    "Public key algorithms are fundamental security primitives in modern cryptosystems, including applications and protocols which offer assurance of the confidentiality, authenticity and non-repudiability of electronic communications and data storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key operation needed in our case is P = eG, which is an asymmetric equation. It's easy to compute P when e and G are known, but we cannot easily compute e when we know P and G.\n",
    "e is the private key and P the public key. The private key is a single 256-bit number and the public key is a coordinate (x,y), where x and y are each 256-bit numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ECDSA\n",
    "\n",
    "ECDSA stands for Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm.\n",
    "ECDSA is based on the mathematics of elliptic curves, which offer a high level of security with shorter key lengths compared to traditional algorithms like RSA.\n",
    "\n",
    "Digital Signatures are used to ensure the authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation of data. With a digital signature a sender can sign a message to prove its origin. Recipients can verify the signature to ensure the message has not been tampered with and indeed came from the claimed sender.\n",
    "\n",
    "In ECDSA each participant generates a pair of cryptographic keys a private key and a corresponding public key. The private key is a randomly generated secret number, while the public key is derived from the private key using elliptic curve operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a digital signature using ECDSA, the following steps are performed:\n",
    "- Hashing\n",
    "- Random number generation\n",
    "- Signature calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the validation process, to verify a received signature the recipient performs the following steps:\n",
    "- Hashing\n",
    "- Public key derivation\n",
    "- Signature verification\n",
    "\n",
    "The security of the ECDSA depends on the size of the elliptic curve used and the length of the private key. The larger the curve and key length, the more secure the signature is.\n",
    "In Bitcoin the length of the key is 256 bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SEC Format\n",
    "The Standards for Efficient Cryptography (SEC) is the standard method for encoding a Bitcoin public key. A Bitcoin public key is a point on the elliptic curve, called secp256k1, and thus has an x and y coordinate.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, each x value only has two possible y values, and due to the nature of secp256k1, one of these y values is odd and the other is even for every x value. Thus, the x value and the parity of the y value are sufficient to identify the public key. The parity of the y value is displayed by either a 0x02 or an 0x03 byte, indicating even or odd respectively. This is followed by the x value, which is a 32 byte number.\n",
    "\n",
    "This format is called compressed, because it only takes up 33 bytes, compared with the uncompressed SEC format, which begins with an 0x04 prefix followed by the full x and y values and takes up 65 bytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### DER Signatures\n",
    "DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) is a binary encoding format used to represent data structures in public key cryptography. DER signatures are a type of encoding used to guarantee the suitability of a digital signature under any environment, and are used in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies to ensure the validity of signatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "A digital signature is a cryptographic technique that provides integrity, authenticity, and non-repudiation to data. It allows the recipient of a message or data to verify that it came from the claimed sender and has not been altered during transmission. Digital signatures are based on asymmetric cryptography, which involves the use of a public-private key pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of creating a digital signature involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generating the Message Digest: The original data (message) is first passed through a one-way cryptographic hash function (e.g., SHA-256). This produces a fixed-size output called the message digest or hash value.\n",
    "2. Signing the Digest: The signer's private key is used to encrypt the message digest, creating the digital signature. This process is typically performed using an algorithm like RSA or ECDSA.\n",
    "3. Encoding the Signature: The resulting digital signature is then encoded in DER format before attaching it to the original message.\n",
    "\n",
    "A DER signature consists of two main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. R (Positive Integer): The first component represents part of the signature value. It is a positive integer that represents a point on the elliptic curve (in the case of ECDSA) or a number in the case of RSA.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. S (Positive Integer): The second component also represents part of the signature value. Like R, it is a positive integer that complements R to create the complete signature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both R and S are critical components for verifying the digital signature. They are used in the verification process to ensure the authenticity of the signature and the integrity of the data."

    "#### HMAC\n",
    "\n",
    "HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) is a specific type of message authentication code (MAC) that provides a way to verify the integrity and authenticity of a message or data. It is widely used in various network protocols and applications to ensure data integrity and prevent tampering.\n",
    "\n",
    "HMAC uses a cryptographic hash function in combination with a secret key to generate a fixed-size output (the MAC) for a given input (the message). The HMAC algorithm is designed to be resistant to various cryptographic attacks, including collision attacks and length extension attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The HMAC process can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Input: A message (M) that needs to be protected, and a secret key (K) known only to the sender and receiver.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Hash Function: HMAC uses a cryptographic hash function, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512, which takes an arbitrary-length message and produces a fixed-size hash value.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Key Padding: If the secret key (K) is shorter than the block size of the hash function, it is padded to match the block size. If it is longer, it is first hashed to reduce it to the correct size.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Inner Padding: The XOR (exclusive OR) operation is applied to the padded key and a constant value to create the inner padding.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Outer Padding: The XOR operation is applied to the padded key and a different constant value to create the outer padding.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Hash Computation: The inner padding is concatenated with the message (M), and the resulting data is hashed using the hash function. Then, the outer padding is concatenated with the previous hash result, and the resulting data is hashed again.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Output: The final hash value is the HMAC, which serves as the message authentication code.\n",
    "\n",
    "HMAC provides several security properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Integrity: The receiver can verify the integrity of the message by recomputing the HMAC using the received message and the shared secret key and comparing it to the received HMAC.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Authenticity: Since the HMAC is based on the secret key, it ensures that the message was generated by someone possessing the key.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Keyed Hashing: HMAC uses a secret key, making it different from standard hash functions, which only provide integrity but not authenticity.\n",
    "\n",
    "HMAC is widely used in various security protocols, such as IPsec, TLS, and SSH, to ensure the authenticity and integrity of transmitted data, and it is an essential component of secure communication on the internet."

    "\n",
    "In the Bitcoin network, public-key cryptography is used to secure transactions and manage ownership of funds.\n",
    "\n",
    "A *private key* in Bitcoin is a randomly generated 256-bit number (64 characters in hexadecimal format). It is the most critical piece of information in a Bitcoin wallet as it grants control and ownership over the associated funds.\n",
    "With the private key, is possible to create digital signatures that authenticate the transactions and spend the bitcoins associated with the corresponding public address.\n",
    "So it's essential to keep the private key secure and confidential.\n",
    "\n",
    "A *Public key* is derived from the private key using the elliptic curve cryptography, in particular the public key it's a point on the elliptic curve and can be represented as an uncompressed 65 bytes hexadecimal value or as compressed 33 bytes hexadecimal value.\n",
    "The public key is used to create a Bitcoin address and verify digital signatures generated by the associated private key.\n",
    "Unlike the private key, the public key can be shared openly without compromising the security of the funds.\n",
    "\n",
    "A *Bitcoin address* is a shorter and more user-friendly representation of the public key. It's tipically 26-35 characters long, starts with \"1\", \"3\", or \"bc1\", and can be used as a unique identifier for the public key.\n",
    "The address is used to receive funds. The process of converting the public key to a Bitcoin address is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Hashing the public key with SHA-256.\n",
    "2. Hashing the result again with RIPEMD-160.\n",
    "3. Adding the version byte (0x00 in case of mainnet address) to the end of the result and generate a 4-byte checksum.\n",
    "4. Encoding the data using Base58Check to create the final Bitcoin address.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that while a public key can be derived from a private key, the reverse is not computationally feasible. That means you cannot obtain a private key from a public key or Bitcoin address, ensuring the security of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Private keys, public keys, and addresses are integral components of Bitcoin's cryptographic system.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, the private key allows you to control the associated funds, the public key is used to create addresses and verify signatures, and the address is used for receiving funds and representing the public key in a user-friendly way"
